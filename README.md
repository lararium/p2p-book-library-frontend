# p2p-book-library-frontend

A demo application for playing with [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react).

The backend will be based on the [p2p-book-library-backend](https://github.com/wanhongfu/p2p-book-library-backend) module which is duplicated from example module 'boot-api' of [SpringSide4](https://github.com/springside/springside4).
